# Local setup

To get started on developing this project firs you need to do

## Notes

* Mailhog url: `localhost:${MAILHOG_PORT}`
* PGAdmin url: `localhost:${PGADMIN_PORT}`
* I've set up a virtual host on my machine to be able to easily run the app

### Virtual Host Example:

```apacheconf
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerAdmin admin@example.com
    DocumentRoot "/Projects/did-you-buy-it-api"
    ServerName dybi.local
    ServerAlias www.dybi.local
    ErrorLog "/Projects/did-you-buy-it-api/logs/error.log"
    CustomLog "/Projects/did-you-buy-it-api/logs/access.log" common
    <Directory "/Projects/did-you-buy-it-api">
        Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
            AllowOverride All
            Require all granted          
    </Directory>
</VirtualHost>
```

Don't forget to add this to your hosts

* `/etc/hosts` on Linux / OSx and
* `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts` on Windows) file:

```apacheconf
127.0.0.1 dybi.local
127.0.0.1 www.dybi.local‚èé
